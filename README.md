Satellite trail detection in astronomical images using synthetic data and deep learning

## Overview

This project aims to build a deep learning model that can automatically detect the presence of satellite trails in astronomical images. Satellite trails (bright linear streaks caused by satellites crossing the field of view) are a growing challenge in astronomical surveys and image processing pipelines.

We generate synthetic training data with realistic satellite trails to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) and evaluate its performance on real telescope data.

## Project Goals

- Generate synthetic datasets of astronomical images with and without realistic satellite trails
- Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images as containing a trail or not
- Test and validate the model on real astronomical images

## Why this matters

Satellite trails contaminate astronomical surveys (e.g., LSST, Euclid, Hubble) and can affect data quality. An automated detection tool can help clean large-scale survey images efficiently.
